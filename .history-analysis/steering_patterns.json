  "design_preferences": [
    "Beautiful, unique, and distinctive typography - avoid generic fonts (Arial, Inter, Roboto, system fonts)",
    "Pair distinctive display fonts with refined body fonts for visual hierarchy",
    "Intentional aesthetic direction: pick an extreme (minimalist, maximalist, retro, luxury, playful, etc.) and commit fully to it",
    "Create atmosphere and depth with backgrounds/textures - gradients, noise, geometric patterns, layered transparencies",
    "Use dominant colors with sharp accents - avoid timid, evenly-distributed palettes",
    "CSS variables for consistency and theming (light/dark mode support)",
    "Smooth, organic SVG connections/bridges between UI elements (e.g., flowing shapes between columns and panels)",
    "Smooth CSS transitions and animations for micro-interactions",
    "Unexpected layouts with asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements",
    "Generous negative space OR controlled density depending on aesthetic",
    "Focus on high-impact page load animations with staggered reveals (animation-delay)",
    "Sophisticated drop states for drag-and-drop interactions",
    "Polished visual details: decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays, dramatic shadows",
    "Context-specific character - designs should not feel generic or like 'AI slop'"
  ],
  "rejected_approaches": [
    "Generic AI-generated aesthetics (overused fonts, clichéd color schemes like purple gradients on white)",
    "Try/catch blocks for control flow - fail hard instead",
    "Tailwind CSS for styling - use inline CSS or style blocks",
    "Storing state in Svelte stores - use Svelte 5 runes ($state, $effect, $derived) instead",
    "Dragging out tasks with long implementations - keep code minimal and under 50-200 lines per file",
    "Speculative/over-engineered code - YAGNI principle",
    "Creating new files unnecessarily - edit existing files only",
    "Non-interactive visible elements with click handlers - use proper <button> or <a> elements",
    "Non-semantic HTML that fails accessibility checks",
    "Linear, predictable UI patterns - embrace creativity and distinctiveness",
    "Try/catch for expected errors - use Result/Either patterns or error codes",
    "Broken visual connections - SVG bridges must smoothly connect across boundaries"

  "workflow_preferences": [
    "Use agents/workers for implementation work - don't code directly, delegate tasks",
    "Distribute work to multiple agents in parallel when possible",
    "Use beads issue tracker for project management - don't use markdown TODOs",
    "Task format: 'TASK: [description] WORKING DIRECTORY: [path]' with specific requirements and DONE markers",
    "Keep commits atomic and semantic with verb: description format",
    "Single responsibility per file/component - feature-based organization",
    "Keep files under 200 lines/25KB for maintainability",
    "Edit existing files over creating new ones (exceptions: only if explicitly requested)",
    "Minimal changes per task - focus on one logical change",
    "Use native HTML5 features over heavy frameworks (e.g., HTML5 drag-drop over library solutions)",
    "Child_process.exec for shelling out to bd CLI commands",
    "SSE (Server-Sent Events) for real-time updates instead of polling",
    "Browser verification after implementation - open dev tools to check results"

  "positive_feedback": [
    "Praised keyboard navigation implementation (arrow keys, Enter to edit, Delete to remove, N for new issue)",
    "Appreciated flying card animations for drag-drop visual feedback",
    "Liked filter/search functionality with minimal CSS additions",
    "Positive about dependency removal and UI polish commits",
    "Appreciated SVG bridge implementations that smoothly connect UI elements",
    "Liked when agent work was coordinated and tasks were distributed effectively",
    "Praised when aesthetic direction was clear and distinctive (not generic)",
    "Appreciated animation polish and sophisticated drop state handling"

  "recurring_themes": [
    "Animation and motion - appears 129 times in conversations; critical for polish and user feedback",
    "Svelte 5 runes usage - appears 72 times; strict preference for $state/$effect/$derived over stores",
    "Minimal code/changes - appears 72 times; consistent push for simplicity and restraint",
    "WebSocket integration - appears 28 times; real-time updates and live pane bridging",
    "Keyboard navigation - appears 16 times; accessibility and power user productivity",
    "Mobile responsiveness - appears 16 times; media queries, touch targets, column stacking",
    "Drag-and-drop interactions - appears 14 times; core to Kanban experience",
    "Real data feeding - important that UI uses actual beads data, not mock data",
    "Description/metadata display - need to show full issue details (description, fields, notes)",
    "Design skill integration - use Claude's design capabilities to avoid generic aesthetics"

  "explicit_instructions": [
    "Don't code yourself - use agents/workers to implement tasks",
    "Use Svelte 5 runes ($state, $effect, $derived) NOT stores",
    "Use child_process.exec to call bd CLI commands",
    "Keep code minimal: <50 lines per API file, <200 lines per component file",
    "No Tailwind CSS - use inline styles or style blocks",
    "NO try/catch for control flow - let errors crash early",
    "Edit existing files only - no new files unless explicitly required",
    "Use native HTML5 drag-drop: draggable='true', ondragstart, ondragover, ondrop",
    "Use SSE endpoint for real-time updates instead of polling",
    "Reply with 'BEAD_DONE: [ticket-id] - [brief summary]' when tasks complete",
    "Test in browser after implementation - verify at localhost URLs",
    "Choose clear conceptual design direction - bold maximalism OR refined minimalism, never middle ground",
    "Add proper semantic HTML for accessibility - use <button>, <a> for interactive elements",
    "Use design skill for frontend work - avoid generic/AI-slop aesthetics",
    "Beads should manage the project - use bd commands, not markdown TODOs"
