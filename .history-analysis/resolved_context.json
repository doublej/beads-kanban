Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.",

Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.",

    "original": "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation:\n\n1. **Initial Request**: User asked to implement WebSocket functionalities for a beads-kanban Svelte application. They provided the daemon protocol documentation showing commands: panes, status, add, send, get, rm.\n\n2. **First Implementation Phase**:\n   - I examined the existing `wsStore.svelte.ts` which had basic WebSocket handling for events (init, pane_added, message, delta, status)\n   - User chose \"Full command suite (all 6 commands)\" and \"Fire-and-forget\" response handling\n   - I added command functions: `listPanes()`, `getStatus()`, `addPane()`, `removePane()`, `getPaneOutput()`, `sendToPane()`\n\n3. **UI Controls Addition**:\n   - User confirmed they wanted UI controls added\n   - Added form to add panes, remove buttons, and send message forms to the pane activity sidebar\n\n4. **Logging Addition**:\n   - User asked if there should be logging\n   - Added console logging: `[ws] connecting`, `[ws] connected`, `[ws] disconnected`, `[ws] error`, `[ws] recv`, `[ws] send`\n\n5. **Protocol Mismatch Discovery**:\n   - User shared daemon logs showing Unix socket at `/tmp/claude-agent-viewer.sock`\n   - User confirmed there's a separate WebSocket bridge process\n   - User tested and showed working response: `{\"type\": \"response\", \"data\": {\"ok\": true, \"pane\": \"asdas\"}}`\n   - I discovered the daemon response format differs from wsStore's expected format\n   - I checked daemon code (`daemon.py`, `ws.py`, `pane.py`) and found:\n     - Responses: `{\"type\": \"response\", \"data\": {...}}`\n     - Events: `{\"event\": \"pane_added\"|\"message\"|\"delta\"|\"status\", \"pane\": \"name\", ...}`\n   - Updated wsStore to match actual daemon protocol\n\n6. **Chat Bar Redesign**:\n   - User requested: \"Treat the panes like chats. Show more history and i'd like to pin them in small form to bottom of screen, collapsable\"\n   - User also requested: \"get active panes on load\"\n   - I updated wsStore to:\n     - Added `ChatMessage` interface and message history\n     - Call `listPanes()` and `getStatus()` on WebSocket connect\n     - Handle panes list and status responses to hydrate state\n   - Created new bottom-pinned chat bar UI replacing sidebar:\n     - Connection status indicator\n     - Add agent input\n     - Tabs for each pane with message count badges\n     - Expandable chat windows showing message history\n     - Streaming delta with cursor animation\n\n7. **Current Issue**:\n   - User said \"not seeing it at all now\"\n   - I checked vite output - timestamps were old (05:34)\n   - I killed the stale dev server to restart it\n\nKey Files Modified:\n- `src/lib/wsStore.svelte.ts` - WebSocket store with commands and event handling\n- `src/routes/+page.svelte` - UI changes for chat bar\n\nThe chat bar was placed correctly outside the `.app` div at line 698, CSS was added at line 3222+.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   - Implement WebSocket functionality for a Svelte kanban app to communicate with a daemon via WebSocket bridge (ws://localhost:8765)\n   - Full command suite: panes, status, add, send, get, rm\n   - Fire-and-forget approach (send commands, let broadcast events update state)\n   - Add UI controls for pane management\n   - Add console logging for debugging\n   - Redesign panes as chat-like interface pinned to bottom of screen with collapsible windows\n   - Load active panes on page load\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - WebSocket bridge pattern (Unix socket \u2192 WebSocket)\n   - Svelte 5 runes ($state, $derived)\n   - Daemon protocol with two message types:\n     - Responses: `{\"type\": \"response\", \"data\": {...}}`\n     - Events: `{\"event\": \"pane_added\"|\"message\"|\"delta\"|\"status\", \"pane\": \"name\", ...}`\n   - Fixed position chat bar UI pattern\n   - Message history and streaming delta handling\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - **`src/lib/wsStore.svelte.ts`** - Core WebSocket store\n     - Updated interface to match daemon protocol\n     - Added message history storage\n     - Added command functions\n     ```typescript\n     export interface ChatMessage {\n       role: string;\n       content: string;\n       block_type: string;\n       timestamp?: string;\n     }\n\n     export interface Pane {\n       name: string;\n       pane_type: string;\n       backend: string;\n       streaming: boolean;\n       messages: ChatMessage[];\n       currentDelta: string;\n     }\n     \n     // Command functions\n     export function listPanes() { send({ action: 'panes' }); }\n     export function getStatus() { send({ action: 'status' }); }\n     export function addPane(name: string) { send({ action: 'add', name }); }\n     export function removePane(name: string) { send({ action: 'rm', name }); }\n     export function getPaneOutput(name: string) { send({ action: 'get', name }); }\n     export function sendToPane(name: string, message: string, cwd?: string) {\n       send({ action: 'send', name, message, ...(cwd && { cwd }) });\n     }\n     \n     // Auto-load panes on connect\n     export function connect(url = 'ws://localhost:8765') {\n       ws.onopen = () => {\n         connected = true;\n         console.log('[ws] connected');\n         listPanes();\n         getStatus();\n       };\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/routes/+page.svelte`** - UI changes\n     - Removed old sidebar, added new chat bar at line 697-768\n     - Added state: `let expandedPanes = $state<Set<string>>(new Set());`\n     - Chat bar HTML with tabs, windows, message display\n     - Extensive CSS for chat-bar (lines 3222-3673)\n\n4. Errors and Fixes:\n   - **Protocol mismatch**: wsStore expected `type: \"init\"|\"pane_added\"` but daemon sends `event: \"pane_added\"` and `type: \"response\"` for command results\n     - Fixed by rewriting event handlers to check for `data.event` vs `data.type`\n   - **Stale vite server**: Changes not showing because HMR wasn't picking up changes\n     - Fixed by killing and restarting the dev server\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Investigated daemon protocol by reading `daemon.py`, `ws.py`, `pane.py`\n   - Discovered WebSocket bridge transforms Unix socket to WebSocket\n   - Currently troubleshooting: chat bar not visible after UI redesign\n\n6. All User Messages:\n   - \"use (use design skill when working on this task) find ways to implement the websocket functionalities [+ protocol docs]\"\n   - \"also, get activ panes on load\"\n   - \"its running but im lost as to if its doing anything\"\n   - \"[ws logs showing working connection and response]\"\n   - \"you tell me, i know nothing\" (re: protocol format)\n   - \"Amazing. Treat the panes like chats. Show more history and i'd like to pin them in small form to bottom of screen, collapsable (use design skill when working on this task)\"\n   - \"Should it be logging anything? either websocket or socket?\"\n   - \"not seeing it at all now\"\n   - \"Still nothing\" (confirmation dialog response)\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Fix chat bar visibility issue - currently not showing at all\n   - Verify WebSocket connection and pane loading works with new UI\n\n8. Current Work:\n   User reported \"not seeing it at all now\" after the chat bar redesign. I discovered the vite dev server was stale (timestamps from 05:34) and killed it. The server needs to be restarted to pick up the recent changes to both wsStore and the page component.\n\n   The chat bar was added outside the `.app` div at line 697-768 with CSS at lines 3222-3673. It should appear as a fixed bar at the bottom of the screen.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Restart the vite dev server and verify the chat bar renders:\n   ```bash\n   cd /Users/jurrejan/Documents/development/_management/beads-kanban && npm run dev\n   ```\n   Then have user refresh browser and check if chat bar appears. If still not visible, check browser console for JS errors.\n\n   Quote from recent exchange:\n   - User: \"not seeing it at all now\"\n   - Me: Asked user to confirm, they said \"Still nothing\"\n   - I then killed the stale dev server (shell f96e02).\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions.

Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision.

Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.",

Dont stop\"\n\nThis is the core directive - continuously work through frontend issues in priority order, updating notes in beads, and not stopping until told to.\n\n**My approach**: \n- Set beads context\n- Listed open issues\n- Systematically worked through them, checking status, implementing features/fixes, and closing issues\n- Closed 12 issues total, blocked 1\n\n**Timeline of work completed**:\n1. `beads-kanban-265` - Added issue.id to search matching\n2. `beads-kanban-6rm` - Verified search/filter already implemented, closed\n3. `beads-kanban-6ts` - Verified deeplinking already implemented, closed\n4. `beads-kanban-s4h` - Fixed column crowding with max-height: 100%\n5. `beads-kanban-7fd` - Verified dependencies already implemented, closed\n6. `beads-kanban-yta` - Verified column counts already implemented, closed\n7. `beads-kanban-ixo` - Verified dark mode already implemented, closed\n8. `beads-kanban-u41` - Implemented context menu for priority changes (removed type changing later)\n9. `beads-kanban-cob` - Added collapsible columns with localStorage persistence\n10. `beads-kanban-39a` - Fixed title saving with proper undefined checks\n11. `beads-kanban-don` - Fixed chat bar overlap with padding-bottom\n12. `beads-kanban-meg` - Fixed panel header contrast\n13. `beads-kanban-r6x` - Fixed PATCH endpoint error handling\n14. `beads-kanban-6xk` - Applied Apple-inspired design refresh\n15. `beads-kanban-m1h` - Fixed issue_type not being updateable in bd\n16. `beads-kanban-say` - Added micro-interactions and animations (in progress)\n\n**Key technical problems encountered and fixed**:\n\n1. **PATCH endpoint stderr check issue** (beads-kanban-39a & beads-kanban-r6x): \n   - Initial code checked `if (stderr)` which failed when bd wrote info messages to stderr\n   - Fixed by wrapping in try-catch and only catching actual errors\n   \n2. **Issue type update not supported** (beads-kanban-m1h):\n   - bd update doesn't have --type flag (only for create)\n   - Removed --type from PATCH endpoint and type section from context menu\n\n3. **Column crowding** (beads-kanban-s4h):\n   - Columns weren't scrolling when filled\n   - Fixed with max-height: 100% to constrain height\n\n4. **Context menu initially had unsupported type updates**:\n   - Had to remove after discovering bd doesn't support type changes\n   - Kept only priority changes which are supported\n\n**Files modified**:\n- `/src/routes/+page.svelte` - Main UI file (massive file, ~4400 lines)\n- `/src/routes/api/issues/[id]/+server.ts` - API endpoint for updates\n\n**Most recent work** (beads-kanban-say):\nAdding micro-interactions and animations:\n- Enhanced card hover states with scale and shadow\n- Added copy button animation with scale feedback\n- Added panel slide animation with blur effect\n- Added context menu pop-in animation\n- Added success animation for copy action\n\nThe user then requested a summary.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user requested continuous work on frontend issues from the beads Kanban board: \"Pick anything frontend related from the beads issue list. Dont ask me questions. If you have feedback, leave notes in the issue. Keep picking up the most prioritized frontend issues. Dont stop\"\n   \n   Intent: Systematically work through all frontend-related issues in priority order, implementing features, fixing bugs, and verifying completed work, without interruption or clarification requests.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Svelte 5 reactive state management ($state, $derived)\n   - SvelteKit API endpoints with server-side execution\n   - CSS variables and theming (light/dark mode)\n   - CSS animations and transitions with cubic-bezier easing\n   - localStorage for persistence\n   - Event-driven UI (drag-drop, context menus, keyboard navigation)\n   - Git workflow with beads issue tracking\n   - Apple-inspired design system (SF colors, Inter font, blur effects)\n   - Command execution via Node's child_process (exec)\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   **`/src/routes/+page.svelte` (Main UI Component - ~4400 lines)**\n      - Most critical file for this session, contains entire Kanban UI\n      - Added: `collapsedColumns` state for column collapse feature\n      - Added: `contextMenu` state for right-click context menu\n      - Modified: Search/filter logic to include issue.id matching\n      - Modified: CSS color variables (iOS-inspired palette)\n      - Modified: Font from Outfit to Inter\n      - Modified: Border radius increases (var(--radius-lg): 20px)\n      - Modified: Button hover states with brightness filters instead of box shadows\n      - Modified: Card hover animation (translateY + scale)\n      - Added: Copy button success animation\n      - Added: Panel slide animation with blur effect\n      - Added: Context menu pop-in animation\n      \n      Key code snippet - Updated CSS variables for Apple design:\n      ```\n      :root {\n        --bg-primary: #000000;\n        --bg-secondary: #1c1c1e;\n        --accent-primary: #0a84ff;\n        --radius-sm: 8px;\n        --radius-md: 12px;\n        --radius-lg: 20px;\n        --radius-xl: 28px;\n        --shadow-sm: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n        --shadow-md: 0 4px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n        --shadow-lg: 0 8px 40px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Key code snippet - Collapsible columns implementation:\n      ```\n      function toggleColumnCollapse(key: string) {\n        const next = new Set(collapsedColumns);\n        if (next.has(key)) {\n          next.delete(key);\n        } else {\n          next.add(key);\n        }\n        collapsedColumns = next;\n        if (browser) {\n          localStorage.setItem('collapsedColumns', JSON.stringify([...next]));\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Key code snippet - Context menu for priority changes:\n      ```\n      async function setIssuePriority(id: string, priority: number) {\n        await updateIssue(id, { priority });\n        closeContextMenu();\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Key code snippet - Micro-interaction animations:\n      ```\n      @keyframes copySuccess {\n        0% { transform: scale(1); }\n        50% { transform: scale(1.2); }\n        100% { transform: scale(1); }\n      }\n      \n      @keyframes panelSlideIn {\n        0% {\n          opacity: 0;\n          transform: scale(0.96) translateX(-16px);\n          filter: blur(4px);\n        }\n        100% {\n          opacity: 1;\n          transform: scale(1) translateX(0);\n          filter: blur(0);\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n   **`/src/routes/api/issues/[id]/+server.ts` (API Endpoint)**\n      - Handles PATCH requests for issue updates\n      - Initial issue: Checked `if (stderr)` which failed on info messages\n      - Fixed: Wrapped in try-catch to properly distinguish errors from info output\n      - Critical fix: Removed `--type` flag (bd update doesn't support it)\n      - Supports updating: status, title, description, priority, design, acceptance_criteria, notes\n      - Does NOT support: issue_type (immutable in beads)\n      \n      Key code snippet - Fixed error handling:\n      ```typescript\n      try {\n        const { stdout } = await execAsync(cmd);\n        return json({ success: true, message: stdout.trim() });\n      } catch (err: unknown) {\n        const error = err as { stderr?: string; message?: string };\n        return json({ error: error.stderr || error.message || 'Update failed' }, { status: 500 });\n      }\n      ```\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n\n   **Error 1 - PATCH endpoint threw 500 errors (beads-kanban-39a & beads-kanban-r6x)**:\n      - Root cause: Code checked `if (stderr)` to detect errors, but bd writes info messages to stderr\n      - Fix: Changed to try-catch block that only catches actual exceptions\n      - User feedback: Issue was created when users couldn't save changes\n      - Additional fix: Added proper `!== undefined` checks for title, priority fields\n\n   **Error 2 - Issue type changes not persisting (beads-kanban-m1h)**:\n      - Root cause: bd update command doesn't support --type flag (only bd create does)\n      - Evidence: `bd update --help` showed no --type option\n      - Fix: Removed --type parameter from PATCH endpoint and removed type section from context menu UI\n      - User feedback: Error response showed full bd help output, revealing missing flag\n\n   **Error 3 - Columns crowding when full of issues (beads-kanban-s4h)**:\n      - Root cause: Column had `overflow: hidden` but no height constraint\n      - Fix: Added `max-height: 100%` to `.column` CSS to enable internal scrolling\n      - Issue required 3 close attempts before it stuck\n\n   **Error 4 - Chat bar overlapping content (beads-kanban-don)**:\n      - Root cause: Chat bar was fixed position at bottom, content didn't account for it\n      - Fix: Added `padding-bottom: 48px` to `.app` container\n      - User feedback: Issue marked as design-related, needed visual consideration\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n\n   **Problem 1 - Many \"already implemented\" issues**: \n   - Several issues (search/filter, deeplinking, dependencies, dark mode, column counts) were already in the codebase\n   - Solution: Verified implementation with code inspection, added notes documenting existing features, closed as \"already implemented\"\n   - This revealed good code coverage but documentation gap\n\n   **Problem 2 - Search only matched title/description, not IDs**:\n   - Solution: Modified filteredIssues derived state to include `issue.id.toLowerCase().includes(query)`\n   - Simple one-line addition to search logic\n\n   **Problem 3 - Context menu wanted both priority and type changes**:\n   - Type change support discovered to be missing from backend\n   - Solution: Removed type section from context menu, kept only priority changes\n   - Removed unused `setIssueType` function\n\n   **Problem 4 - Title and priority weren't saving properly**:\n   - Root cause: Used truthy checks (`if (title)`) instead of undefined checks\n   - Fixed by changing to `if (title !== undefined)` to allow falsy but valid values\n\n6.

Pending Tasks:\n   - Complete work on `beads-kanban-say` (micro-interactions) - currently in progress, added animations but not yet closed\n   - No other explicitly pending tasks - all other open issues have been processed\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Working on `beads-kanban-say` - \"Add more animations, tiny micro ui animations\" - adding delightful micro-interactions to the Kanban UI:\n   \n   **Changes made to `/src/routes/+page.svelte`**:\n   - Enhanced `.card:hover` to include scale(1.01) for subtle lift effect\n   - Added `.card:active` with scale(0.99) for press feedback\n   - Enhanced `.card.dragging` with scale(1.05) and larger rotation\n   - Updated `cardEnter` animation from 1s to 600ms for snappier feel\n   - Enhanced `.btn-copy` with hover scale effects and success animation (scale pulse from 1 to 1.2 to 1)\n   - Added `copySuccess` animation keyframes for tactile feedback\n   - Enhanced panel slide animation to include blur effect on entry\n   - Added context menu animation: `contextMenuIn` with scale and opacity transition\n   - Updated button transitions to use brightness filter instead of shadow changes\n   - Increased button border radius from `var(--radius-md)` to `var(--radius-lg)`\n\n   **Remaining work on this issue**:\n   - Issue is in_progress but not yet closed\n   - All animations have been added to CSS\n   - No TypeScript logic changes needed for animations\n\n9.

Dont stop\".\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.\n[Context from prior message: new tickets...]"

Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.",

Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.\n\n[Context from prior message: Base directory for this skill: /Users/jurrejan/.claude/plugins/cache/anthropic-a...]"

The system showed 38 total issues, with stats showing average lead time of ~51 min.\n\n2. **User Request**: \"Keep grabbing tickets\" - The user wants me to continuously work on tickets from the beads issue tracker.\n\n3. **Ticket Work Flow**:\n   - First batch of tickets was empty, user said to set 5m timer when tickets run out\n   - I set background timers to check for new tickets every 5 minutes\n   - User mentioned \"(use design skill when working on this task)\" for design-related tickets\n\n4. **Tickets Completed**:\n   - **beads-kanban-t8z**: Priority design and label - Changed priority labels from abbreviations (C1, H2) to full words (Critical, High, Medium, Low), monospace font, colored same as border\n   - **beads-kanban-7wg**: Align type icon with beads id - Changed type indicator position from 0.5rem to 0.875rem\n   - **beads-kanban-12t**: Priority label scaled down - Reduced font from 0.5625rem to 0.4375rem\n   - **beads-kanban-tyx**: Add label back to type definition - Type indicator moved to bottom right with icon + label text, agent chip moved to top right. **USER REVERTED THIS** - \"NO what did you do to the beautiful active agent chip, revert it now\"\n   - **beads-kanban-px2**: Remove white bg from top bar - Made header transparent\n   - **beads-kanban-djs**: Add sort by to each column - Added per-column sort dropdown (priority/newest/title)\n   - **beads-kanban-e1d**: Remove border under top bar - Removed border-bottom from header\n   - **beads-kanban-vid**: Left border radius fix - Added border-radius to priority bar\n   - **beads-kanban-30d**: Dynamic background - Added aurora-like gradient background with soft colorful tones\n   - **beads-kanban-8kn**: Shadow clipping fix - Changed card overflow to visible, added margin for shadows\n   - **beads-kanban-5ao**: Keyboard navigation epic - Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts system\n\n5. **Key User Feedback**:\n   - User got upset about the agent chip changes: \"NO what did you do to the beautiful active agent chip, revert it now\"\n   - I reverted the agent chip to its original position inside card-content with the full SVG icon\n   - User said \"commit and continue\" after revert\n   - User said \"Always keep fetching tickets!\" when I asked if I should work on the keyboard navigation epic\n\n6. **Current State**: Just claimed ticket beads-kanban-vid again (still has border radius issue) when the summary was requested. There are also beads-kanban-30d (tweak background) and beads-kanban-0gc (column transition) ready.\n\nKey files modified:\n- `/Users/jurrejan/Documents/development/_management/beads-kanban/src/routes/+page.svelte` - Main kanban UI file\n\nMajor CSS/functionality changes:\n- Priority labels: full word, monospace, colored, scaled down\n- Type indicator: bottom right with icon + label\n- Agent chip: kept original styling (reverted)\n- Column sort dropdown\n- Dynamic aurora gradient background\n- Keyboard navigation with help overlay\n- Shadow clipping fixes\n- Header styling (transparent, no border)\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user wants me to continuously grab and complete tickets from the beads issue tracker for the beads-kanban project. The user explicitly said \"Keep grabbing tickets\" and later \"Always keep fetching tickets!\" when I asked whether to continue. When tickets run out, set a 5 minute timer and check again. Use the \"frontend-design\" skill for design-related tasks.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Beads issue tracking system with MCP tools (`mcp__plugin_beads_beads__*`)\n   - SvelteKit/Svelte 5 with `$state` runes for reactivity\n   - CSS custom properties (variables) for theming\n   - Keyboard event handling in Svelte (`onkeydown`, `onkeyup`)\n   - CSS animations and transitions\n   - Radial gradients for aurora-like background effects\n   - Flexbox layout for card components\n   - Border-radius handling with overflow\n\n3.

Errors and fixes:\n   - **Agent chip position change rejected by user**: I moved the agent chip to a corner position with a simpler design. User said \"NO what did you do to the beautiful active agent chip, revert it now\". Fixed by reverting to original agent-chip inside card-content with full SVG icon and styling.\n   - **Edit tool \"string not found\" errors**: Had issues with whitespace/tabs. Fixed by reading the exact content first and matching indentation.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Shadow clipping: Fixed by changing card `overflow: hidden` to `overflow: visible` and adding margin for breathing room\n   - Priority bar corner alignment: Added `border-radius: var(--radius-md) 0 0 var(--radius-md)` to match card corners\n   - Keyboard shortcuts: Created comprehensive system with help overlay, vim-style navigation, and subtle hotkey hints that appear when holding Alt\n\n6.

Current Work:\n   Just claimed ticket **beads-kanban-vid** which is about the left border/priority bar border-radius still not aligning properly. The user says \"I can see the border radius but it doesnt align, its like its larger\". The current CSS for the priority bar has:\n   ```css\n   .card-priority-bar {\n     width: 3px;\n     flex-shrink: 0;\n     position: relative;\n     display: flex;\n     align-items: flex-start;\n     background: var(--priority-bar-color);\n     border-radius: var(--radius-md) 0 0 var(--radius-md);\n   }\n   ```\n   The issue is that `--radius-md` (12px) might be too large for a 3px wide bar, making it look misaligned.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Fix the border-radius alignment for beads-kanban-vid. The priority bar is 3px wide but using `--radius-md` (12px) for border-radius, which is larger than the bar width. Should adjust to a smaller radius like 3px or 4px to match the bar width.\n   \n   User's exact ticket: \"Still issue: left border is no longer cropped by the border radius - I can see the border radius but it doesnt align, its like its larger\".\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions.

Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.",

    "original": "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLet me analyze the conversation chronologically to capture all important details:\n\n1. **Previous Context (from summary)**: User was working on beads-kanban project, continuously grabbing and completing tickets from the beads issue tracker. Multiple tickets were completed including priority design, border radius fixes, background aurora, keyboard navigation, etc.\n\n2. **Session Continuation**: The session continued with me working on tickets. Let me trace through each:\n\n**Ticket: beads-kanban-vid (border radius fix)**\n- Fixed border-radius alignment by using `clip-path: inset(0 round var(--radius-md))` on the card\n- Removed border-radius from priority bar since clip-path handles it\n\n**Ticket: beads-kanban-30d (background tweak)**\n- Updated aurora gradients to focus colors around center-top\n- Added edge fade for lighter outside\n\n**Ticket: beads-kanban-0gc (column transition)**\n- Implemented blue strobe teleport effect with 5 ghost frames\n- Added `teleports` state, `cardRefs` map, `registerCard` action\n- Created CSS animations for teleport ghosts\n\n**Ticket: beads-kanban-cao (form elements upgrade)**\n- First attempt: Added gradient backgrounds, 0.5px borders, inner shadows\n- User feedback: \"too grey, too much contrast, elements too small, make it more fresh\"\n- Second attempt: Changed to translucent white backgrounds `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.04)`, softer borders, larger padding/fonts\n\n**Ticket: beads-kanban-74i (title focus on new issue)**\n- Added `requestAnimationFrame` to focus title input when opening new issue panel\n\n**Ticket: beads-kanban-ht1 (contextual hotkey hints)**\n- Added `esc` hint to panel close buttons\n- Added `o/x/hjkl` hints on selected cards\n\n**Ticket: beads-kanban-0ob (drag-to-link redesign)**\n- Redesigned with curved bezier path instead of straight line\n- Added flowing particle animation with dash offset\n- Electric cyan color scheme with glowing nodes\n\n**Ticket: beads-kanban-57l (priority label on hover)**\n- Made priority label hidden by default, visible on hover/selected\n\n**Ticket: beads-kanban-0gc (column transition feedback)**\n- User wants invisible placeholder to \"make room\" first\n- Started implementing placeholder system with `placeholders` state and `placeholderRefs`\n- Updated `triggerTeleport` to use placeholder positions\n- Was in the middle of updating SSE handler when summary was requested\n\nUser messages during this session:\n- \"carry on\" - instructing to continue working on tickets\n- Various ticket descriptions via beads system\n\nKey files modified:\n- `/Users/jurrejan/Documents/development/_management/beads-kanban/src/routes/+page.svelte`\n\nCurrent work state:\n- Working on beads-kanban-0gc feedback - adding placeholder system for column transition\n- Just added placeholder state and refs\n- Need to update SSE handler to create placeholders before triggering teleport\n- Need to add placeholder rendering in template\n- Need to add placeholder CSS\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user wants me to continuously grab and complete tickets from the beads issue tracker for the beads-kanban project. When tickets run out, wait and check again.

    "clarified_prompt": "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLet me analyze the conversation chronologically to capture all important details:\n\n1. **Previous Context (from summary)**: User was working on beads-kanban project, continuously grabbing and completing tickets from the beads issue tracker. Multiple tickets were completed including priority design, border radius fixes, background aurora, keyboard navigation, etc.\n\n2. **Session Continuation**: The session continued with me working on tickets. Let me trace through each:\n\n**Ticket: beads-kanban-vid (border radius fix)**\n- Fixed border-radius alignment by using `clip-path: inset(0 round var(--radius-md))` on the card\n- Removed border-radius from priority bar since clip-path handles it\n\n**Ticket: beads-kanban-30d (background tweak)**\n- Updated aurora gradients to focus colors around center-top\n- Added edge fade for lighter outside\n\n**Ticket: beads-kanban-0gc (column transition)**\n- Implemented blue strobe teleport effect with 5 ghost frames\n- Added `teleports` state, `cardRefs` map, `registerCard` action\n- Created CSS animations for teleport ghosts\n\n**Ticket: beads-kanban-cao (form elements upgrade)**\n- First attempt: Added gradient backgrounds, 0.5px borders, inner shadows\n- User feedback: \"too grey, too much contrast, elements too small, make it more fresh\"\n- Second attempt: Changed to translucent white backgrounds `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.04)`, softer borders, larger padding/fonts\n\n**Ticket: beads-kanban-74i (title focus on new issue)**\n- Added `requestAnimationFrame` to focus title input when opening new issue panel\n\n**Ticket: beads-kanban-ht1 (contextual hotkey hints)**\n- Added `esc` hint to panel close buttons\n- Added `o/x/hjkl` hints on selected cards\n\n**Ticket: beads-kanban-0ob (drag-to-link redesign)**\n- Redesigned with curved bezier path instead of straight line\n- Added flowing particle animation with dash offset\n- Electric cyan color scheme with glowing nodes\n\n**Ticket: beads-kanban-57l (priority label on hover)**\n- Made priority label hidden by default, visible on hover/selected\n\n**Ticket: beads-kanban-0gc (column transition feedback)**\n- User wants invisible placeholder to \"make room\" first\n- Started implementing placeholder system with `placeholders` state and `placeholderRefs`\n- Updated `triggerTeleport` to use placeholder positions\n- Was in the middle of updating SSE handler when summary was requested\n\nUser messages during this session:\n- \"carry on\" - instructing to continue working on tickets\n- Various ticket descriptions via beads system\n\nKey files modified:\n- `/Users/jurrejan/Documents/development/_management/beads-kanban/src/routes/+page.svelte`\n\nCurrent work state:\n- Working on beads-kanban-0gc feedback - adding placeholder system for column transition\n- Just added placeholder state and refs\n- Need to update SSE handler to create placeholders before triggering teleport\n- Need to add placeholder rendering in template\n- Need to add placeholder CSS\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user wants me to continuously grab and complete tickets from the beads issue tracker for the beads-kanban project. When tickets run out, wait and check again.

Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build.

Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from.

Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.",

    "original": "Base directory for this skill: /Users/jurrejan/.claude/skills/animation-easing\n\n# Animation Easing: Theory & Practice\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill teaches animation easing functions\u2014the mathematical curves that control how objects accelerate and decelerate during animations. Whether you're building a UI transition, designing a game animation, or creating an interactive experience, choosing the right easing function dramatically impacts how your animation feels to the user.\n\nThe skill covers:\n- **Easing families** (ease-out, ease-in-out, bounce, elastic, spring, and more)\n- **Timing guidelines** by platform and context\n- **Real-world examples** from production interfaces (Apple, Google, Stripe, Figma)\n- **Best practices** for responsive, accessible animations\n- **Decision trees** to help choose the right easing for your specific use case\n\n## Quick Start: Choose Your Easing\n\nMost animations fall into these categories:\n\n### 1. UI Element Appearing (Modal, Button, Alert)\n**Use:** Ease-out\n**Duration:** 200-500ms\n**Why:** Fast start (responsive), slow end (polished landing)\n**CSS:** `cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1)`\n\n### 2. Element Moving Between Positions\n**Use:** Ease-in-out\n**Duration:** 300-500ms\n**Why:** Symmetric curve feels balanced\n**CSS:** `cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1)`\n\n### 3. Element Disappearing\n**Use:** Ease-in\n**Duration:** 150-300ms\n**Why:** Quick departure feels obedient\n**CSS:** `cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 1.0, 1.0)`\n\n### 4. Loading/Continuous Effect\n**Use:** Linear\n**Duration:** Continuous\n**Why:** Mechanical feel appropriate for process\n**CSS:** `linear`\n\n### 5. Playful/Gaming Interface (Bounce, Spring)\n**Use:** Bounce or Elastic\n**Duration:** 800-1200ms minimum\n**Why:** Personality and delight\n**Caution:** Only for casual/gaming interfaces\n\n## Core Easing Functions Explained\n\nSee **[EASING GUIDE](references/easing-guide.md)** for comprehensive coverage of all easing families:\n\n- **Ease-Out:** Fast start, slow end (responsive, polished)\n- **Ease-In-Out:** Symmetric S-curve (balanced)\n- **Ease-In:** Slow start, fast end (obedient exit)\n- **Linear:** Constant speed (mechanical)\n- **Back:** Anticipatory overshoot (playful)\n- **Bounce:** Physics-based collision (realistic)\n- **Elastic:** Spring-like oscillation (fun)\n- **Spring Physics:** Velocity-aware, damping-based (responsive)\n\nEach has specific use cases, duration requirements, and personality traits.\n\n## Platform-Specific Timing\n\nChoose your base duration by platform:\n\n### Mobile\n- **Baseline:** 300ms\n- **Adjust for:** Responsive feel on small screens\n- **Touch feedback:** Respond within 100ms\n\n### Desktop\n- **Baseline:** 150-200ms\n- **Adjust for:** Faster, more predictable interactions\n- **Mouse precision:** Quicker feedback expected\n\n### Tablet\n- **Baseline:** 390ms (30% longer than mobile)\n- **Adjust for:** Larger screens, more space to traverse\n\n### Wearables\n- **Baseline:** 210ms (30% shorter than mobile)\n- **Adjust for:** Minimal screen real estate, quick glances\n\n**Principle:** Longer distances and larger screens = longer durations.

Whether you're building a UI transition, designing a game animation, or creating an interactive experience, choosing the right easing function dramatically impacts how your animation feels to the user.\n\nThe skill covers:\n- **Easing families** (ease-out, ease-in-out, bounce, elastic, spring, and more)\n- **Timing guidelines** by platform and context\n- **Real-world examples** from production interfaces (Apple, Google, Stripe, Figma)\n- **Best practices** for responsive, accessible animations\n- **Decision trees** to help choose the right easing for your specific use case\n\n## Quick Start: Choose Your Easing\n\nMost animations fall into these categories:\n\n### 1. UI Element Appearing (Modal, Button, Alert)\n**Use:** Ease-out\n**Duration:** 200-500ms\n**Why:** Fast start (responsive), slow end (polished landing)\n**CSS:** `cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1)`\n\n### 2. Element Moving Between Positions\n**Use:** Ease-in-out\n**Duration:** 300-500ms\n**Why:** Symmetric curve feels balanced\n**CSS:** `cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1)`\n\n### 3. Element Disappearing\n**Use:** Ease-in\n**Duration:** 150-300ms\n**Why:** Quick departure feels obedient\n**CSS:** `cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 1.0, 1.0)`\n\n### 4. Loading/Continuous Effect\n**Use:** Linear\n**Duration:** Continuous\n**Why:** Mechanical feel appropriate for process\n**CSS:** `linear`\n\n### 5. Playful/Gaming Interface (Bounce, Spring)\n**Use:** Bounce or Elastic\n**Duration:** 800-1200ms minimum\n**Why:** Personality and delight\n**Caution:** Only for casual/gaming interfaces\n\n## Core Easing Functions Explained\n\nSee **[EASING GUIDE](references/easing-guide.md)** for comprehensive coverage of all easing families:\n\n- **Ease-Out:** Fast start, slow end (responsive, polished)\n- **Ease-In-Out:** Symmetric S-curve (balanced)\n- **Ease-In:** Slow start, fast end (obedient exit)\n- **Linear:** Constant speed (mechanical)\n- **Back:** Anticipatory overshoot (playful)\n- **Bounce:** Physics-based collision (realistic)\n- **Elastic:** Spring-like oscillation (fun)\n- **Spring Physics:** Velocity-aware, damping-based (responsive)\n\nEach has specific use cases, duration requirements, and personality traits.\n\n## Platform-Specific Timing\n\nChoose your base duration by platform:\n\n### Mobile\n- **Baseline:** 300ms\n- **Adjust for:** Responsive feel on small screens\n- **Touch feedback:** Respond within 100ms\n\n### Desktop\n- **Baseline:** 150-200ms\n- **Adjust for:** Faster, more predictable interactions\n- **Mouse precision:** Quicker feedback expected\n\n### Tablet\n- **Baseline:** 390ms (30% longer than mobile)\n- **Adjust for:** Larger screens, more space to traverse\n\n### Wearables\n- **Baseline:** 210ms (30% shorter than mobile)\n- **Adjust for:** Minimal screen real estate, quick glances\n\n**Principle:** Longer distances and larger screens = longer durations. Mobile users are more impatient than desktop users.\n\n## Animation Selection Decision Tree\n\n```\nWhat type of animation are you creating?\n\n\u251c\u2500 UI element appearing?\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500 Use EASE-OUT (responsive, lands gently)\n\u2502     Example: Modal fade-in, button appearance, notification entry\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500 Element moving between positions?\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500 Use EASE-IN-OUT (symmetric, balanced)\n\u2502     Example: Expanding accordion, sliding drawer, position shift\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500 Element disappearing?\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500 Use EASE-IN (quick departure)\n\u2502     Example: Modal close, notification dismiss, menu exit\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500 Mechanical/continuous effect?\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500 Use LINEAR (constant speed)\n\u2502     Example: Spinner, progress bar, rotating loader\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500 Playful/Personality-focused?\n   \u251c\u2500 Want snappy anticipation?\n   \u2502  \u2514\u2500 Use BACK (wind-up effect)\n   \u2502     Duration: 400-600ms\n   \u2502     Example: Button press, playful reveal\n   \u2502\n   \u251c\u2500 Want physics-like bounce?\n   \u2502  \u2514\u2500 Use BOUNCE (realistic collision)\n   \u2502     Duration: 800-1200ms minimum\n   \u2502     Example: Drop animation, landing effect\n   \u2502\n   \u2514\u2500 Want springy rubber band?\n      \u2514\u2500 Use ELASTIC (spring oscillation)\n         Duration: 800-1200ms minimum\n         Example: Attention-grabbing, fun interactions\n```\n\n## Material Design Motion Standards\n\nGoogle's Material Design defines standard motion for professional interfaces:\n\n**Standard Curve:** `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1)`\n- Use for: Material growth, property changes, persistent transitions\n- Duration mobile: 300ms\n- Duration desktop: 200ms\n\n**Deceleration:** `cubic-bezier(0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1)` (pure ease-out)\n- Use for: Elements entering screen\n- Duration: 225ms\n\n**Acceleration:** `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 1, 1)` (pure ease-in)\n- Use for: Elements leaving screen\n- Duration: 195ms (20% shorter than entry)\n\n**The Courteous Squire Rule:**\n- **Entering:** Fast arrival (ease-out), slow landing\n- **Exiting:** Quick departure (ease-in)\n- **Psychology:** Asymmetry feels natural.

Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision.

Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.",

Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.",
